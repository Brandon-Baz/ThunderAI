> **Using ChatGPT**
> 
> There is no need for an API key and is possibile to use this extension even with a free account, using the web interface!
> 
> Starting from version 2.0.0, if you want to connect with the OpenAI API integration, now you can use an API Key!

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Using Ollama**
>
> From version 2.1.0 is possible to use a local Ollama server!
>
> Just remember to add `OLLAMA_ORIGINS = moz-extension://*` to the Ollama server environment variables.
>
